        <p><i>For most capitals and cities in western countries, museums of history, arts, and nature are basic configurations in which these cities offer. 
            Ottawa would be a good example of such, being the capital of Canada and having over 10 museums. 
            Out of all of the museums in Ottawa, visitors always seem to be going back to the same one,  The Canadian Museum of Nature. 
            This particular museum has had an 8 year, multi-million dollar renovation. To add, the Museum of Nature is also the largest museum of nature in Canada. 
            It's located in an old Victorian building in downtown Ottawa.</i>

            This year, students from the <b> Media Production and Design Program in Carleton University </b> is fortunate to collaborate with the museum to design interactive activities for the different exhibit hosted in the museum.
            One of the exhibit held during the year is the <u> "Butterflies in Flight," </u> the prototype that we created was based on this exhibit.
            The prototype selected will be a VR game that will be placed in the first room of the butterfly exhibit. 
            The VR prototype is designed to enhance the butterfly exhibit by giving guests a different perspective and it actually puts the user into world of a butterfly.

            "The prototype will be a stand-alone addition to museumâ€™s first room of butterfly exhibit. Giving visitors to look at other activities and try our prototype" - Jada, Team Leader and Supervisor
        </br>
            "The game will consist of portraying the habitat, lifecycle and the different breeds of butterflies. Connecting well to what visitors will see in the exhibit" - Sama, Creative Designer
        </br>
            "Our prototype is dedicated to two purposes. To improve the Butterfly Exhibit and to give visitors a new exciting experience during their museum visit." - Coco, Narrative Creator and Programmer 
        </br>
            "By having an educational VR game, we will be able to educate people in a more engaging way that will be memorable to them." - Steve, Creative Director
        </br>
            "There is room for improvements, including more multimedia experiences that would help catch the interest of children and parents." - Art, Editor and Media Assistant
        </br>
            "This project will definitely result in giving a fun experience for future visitors of this exhibit." - Quincere, Media Assistant and researcher
